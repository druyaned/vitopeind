# Vita Operatio Indicator

The project helps to track life activity by coloring from red to green
years, months and days. All you need is to start or stop the activity,
and to choose the level of personal efficiency from `-10` to `+10`.
Also a description can be added. All other calculations does Vitopeind.

Previous version of the project is
[Active Recorder](https://github.com/druyaned/active-recorder)
, which is
a desktop application with GUI. Here the basic logic (base module) is done
by now. Graphics and other additions coming soon.
